# color-scheme-generator

This React app takes a user provided image and extracts its colors for use in a color scheme.

The colors in the scheme are based on the quantity of pixels in specific color ranges that are found within the image.

The program process itself is simple - all you have to do is pick an image and click upload. 
The user can also optionally play around with the scheme, by swapping colors, editing colors, and more. 
Results from the program can be downloaded as a pdf for future use. 

Please feel free to leave me any comments or suggestions!
